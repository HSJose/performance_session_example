#### Appium Load Balancer.
This is a feature that allow for strategies for choosing a device based on selectors. This makes it simpler to manage tests by not having to worry
about specify a particular device and instead define a class or type of device. More information available in our documentation. Also at any time a device 
can be specified by providing the UDID capability. This makes adding the Appium Load Balancer functionality more intuitive.
